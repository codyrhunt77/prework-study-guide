## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation for this prework study guide was to help build a basic understanding of several tools and languages that will be used in the course such as git, CSS, JavaScript, and Visual Studio Code. I built this project to help prepare me for the course, and to also to grasp the basics of the provided programs. The project helped solve problems by teaching the material in a hands on approach, which really helps when it comes to the human error of things. It makes the student aware of mistakes and lets them figure it out on their own, or with the help of the provided guide. It teaches how to interact with github and gitbash branches and repos, the basics of style sheets with CSS, and how to use functions and loops with JavaScript.
